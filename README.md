Apache Arrow is a universal columnar format and multi-language toolbox for fast data interchange and in-memory analytics.

The project specifies a language-independent column-oriented memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. 

The project houses an actively developed lybrary written in Nim for solving problems related to data transfer and in-memory analytical processing. This includes such topics as:

    Zero-copy shared memory and RPC-based data movement

    Reading and writing file formats (like CSV, Apache ORC, and Apache Parquet)

    In-memory analytics and query processing
